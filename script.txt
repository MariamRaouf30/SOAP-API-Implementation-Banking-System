Hi everyone! Today, I’m going to talk about our SOAP-based banking system. 
SOAP, or Simple Object Access Protocol, is a protocol used for secure and structured communication in web services. 
It’s perfect for industries like banking, where security and reliability are critical.

Why SOAP?
So, why did we choose SOAP? Well, SOAP has some key advantages:
Security: It supports WS-Security, which encrypts and authenticates data, making it ideal for handling sensitive financial information.
Reliability: SOAP uses XML for structured communication, ensuring that transactions are error-free.
Complexity: It can handle complex operations, like fund transfers, with ease."

The Banking System:
Our project is a banking system where users can check their account balance and transfer funds securely. The system has two main parts:
The SOAP Server, which handles requests and interacts with a database.
The SOAP Client, which sends requests to the server and displays the results.
SOAP can be used to build secure and reliable systems for handling financial transactions
